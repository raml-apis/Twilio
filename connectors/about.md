Configuring connector

- In order to run this connector you will need a Twilio account. Credentials used for REST access can be found at [https://www.twilio.com/user/account](https://www.twilio.com/user/account). ACCOUNT SID is considered username and AUTH TOKEN is password.
- Specify username and password in the Authentication tab of the HTTP Request Configuration dialog. Alternatively, you may set corresponding attributes right in the XML file.


Running connector

- Make a call on the http://localhost:8081/twilio URL.
