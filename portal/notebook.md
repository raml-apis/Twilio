#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a Twilio account. Credentials used for REST access can be found at [https://www.twilio.com/user/account](https://www.twilio.com/user/account). At the point of notebook excecution, when you are asked to authorize, you must enter your ACCOUNT SID as username and AUTH TOKEN as password.
- The "Applications, Notifications and Incoming Numbers" notebook requires your account to provide a Twilio incoming phone number and a Notification object. You can force the Notification object creation by, for exmaple, requesting a password reset at [https://www.twilio.com/reset-password](https://www.twilio.com/reset-password) (Note that requesting password reset does not itself changes or disables the password. You will receive an email which may be ignored if you do not really want to reset a password). 
- Running the "Connect Apps, Authorized Connect Apps and Usage" notebook requires some AuthorizedConnectApp object. You may register it at [https://www.twilio.com/user/account/connect/apps/add](https://www.twilio.com/user/account/connect/apps/add). Then you must try opening the https://www.twilio.com/authorize/{YOUR_CONNECT_APP_CID} URL in your browser, and you'll be prompted to authorize the connect app.
- The "Outgoing Caller Id, Available Phone Numbers, Calls" notebook requires your account to provide a Twilio outgoing caller id and a Call object.

If you are not sure that your Twilio account provides a Call object, just make a call on one of Twilio incoming call numbers registered in your account.
